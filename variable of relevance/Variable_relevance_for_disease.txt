After comparing HeartDisease with other variable, we can easily tell that some of them are a very good indication on whether a person has a heart disease. Some of the ones I realised are:

Age (higher = more risk)
Sex (males = higher risk)
ChestPainType (ASY = high risk)
FastingBS (>120 = high risk)
RestingECG (Difference not too significant)
MaxHR (lower = more risk)
ExerciseAngina (Y = high risk)
ST_Slope (Down / Flat = high risk)
Now that our data is ready and we have formed a hypothesis, it's time to move onto the machine learning portion of this challenge.
